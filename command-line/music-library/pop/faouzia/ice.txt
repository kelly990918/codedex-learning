Ice by Faouzia - 'https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvG0F6Qfx8'

üéµLyrics:
Made of ice
The tears won't fall down, no, they're crystallized
My body's numb now, but it's kinda nice
I couldn't take it anymore (I couldn't take it anymore)

Left me crying on the bathroom floor (Bathroom floor)
Wait a minute, what was that all for? (That all for)
Now you're banging on my door like of course
But it's too little, little too late, oh


Made of ice, made of ice
Look at what you made of me
Recognise, recognise
You can't even recognise me
How can you look at my stone-cold eyes>
You took a burning red heart and mad–µ it ice, I'm
Made of ice, mad–µ of ice
Look at what you made of me
I survived, I survived
But every breath I take is heavy
How can you look at my stone-cold eyes?
You took a burning red heart and made it ice, oh-oh

Dead to me (Dead to me)
Have you forgotten what you did to me? (Did to me)
You put my flame out, you say I've changed now
I couldn't take it anymore

You left me crying on the bathroom floor (Bathroom floor)
Wait a minute, what was that all for? (That all for)
Now you're banging on my door like of course
But it's too little, little too late, oh

Made of ice, made of ice
Look at what you made of me
Recognise, recognise
You can't even recognise me
How can you look at my stone-cold eyes? (Eyes)
You took a burning red heart and made it ice, I'm
Made of ice, made of ice
Look at what you made of me
I survived, I survived
But every breath I take is heavy
How can you look at my stone-cold eyes? (Eyes)
You took a burning red heart and made it ice, oh-oh

En premier je senti un froid glacial couler dans mes veines
J'avais peur et ensuite le soulagement avec la r√©alisation qu'enfaite
Mon c≈ìur ne peut plus se briser en deux
Mon c≈ìur ne peut plus se briser en deux
