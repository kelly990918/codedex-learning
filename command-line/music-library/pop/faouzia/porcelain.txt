ðŸŽµLyrics:
Take your heart somewhere else
I don't want any of it anymore
Keep it all to yourself
I don't want any of it anymore

It hurts me to say this, but it hurts me more to stay
My fingers are bleeding from picking up pieces you made of me

I can't let you in
My delicate skin is far too thin, porcelain
And your blade is sharp, you take it too far
It's just who you are, cold cement
And you can't resist with your iron fist
You come crashing down 'til I'm found in pieces and then
You're filled with regret, but soon, you'll forget
And I'm left a mess in your hands

Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm
Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm

I don't want sympathy
I just want anything that's left of me
ThÐµ very least, my sanity
I'm on my knees looking through all this debris
It hurts mÐµ to say this, but it hurts me more to stay
Oh, my fingers are bleeding from picking up pieces you made of me

Oh, I can't let you in
My delicate skin is far too thin, porcelain
And your blade is sharp, you take it too far
It's just who you are, cold cement
And you can't resist with your iron fist
You come crashing down 'til I'm found in pieces and then
You're filled with regret, but soon, you'll forget
And I'm left a mess in your hands

Again, again, again
Again, and again, and again
(Again, yeah)
Again, and again, and again

Oh, I can't let you in
My delicate skin is far too thin, porcelain
And your blade is sharp, you take it too far
It's just who you are, cold cement
And you can't resist with your iron fist
You come crashing down 'til I'm found in pieces and then
You're filled with regret, but soon, you'll forget
And I'm left a mess in your hands

Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm
Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm
Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm
Mm-hm, mm-hm, hm
